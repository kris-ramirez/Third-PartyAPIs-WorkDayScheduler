# Third-PartyAPIs-WorkDayScheduler

## Description

For this project, I made a calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. I built this project to practice my skills around jQuery, Day.js, and JavaScript. Using this scheduler you can schedule out your day and have your events color coded based on whether they are in the past, present, or future. From this project, I learned how to use jQuery in my JavaScript, how to use Day.js to get the current time which I think will be helpful in later projects, and how to work with third-party APIs. 


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this application visit this link: 

There you will find the calendar with the current date.

The hours are color coded based on the current time of day.

You can add/save events to your schedule and they will stay on the page when it is refreshed.
